# What's ViaBus?
‚≠ê ViaBus is a responsive architecture, driven by message bus programming, to achieve complete decoupling of UI and business.

![image](https://github.com/KunMinX/android-viabus-architecture/blob/master/images/viabus_flow.png)

# Why ViaBus?
- In 1 minute, you can understand the structure and use of ViaBus. üí°
- It can be used at the moment, completely compatible with the original project architecture, plug and play. üî•
- Allows incremental refactoring in one hour per day, in business or module units. üíß
- Complete decoupling, no matter writing UI or writing business, is no longer interrupted and not dragged together. üå±
- Real time two-way communication across Activity and cross components can be completed just through the native interface. ‚ö°
- No compile time annotation, and components written in Viabus can be used directly in any project.üåé
- Less repetitive work, flat data interaction, and code reuse rate up to 100%. üí™
- ...

# How to use ViaBus
Add the following random dependency to the module build.gradle
```
//Continuously integrated viabus rapid development framework (including viabus kernels and popular frameworks for rapid product development)
implementation "com.kunminx.viabus:viabus-architecture:0.4.4"

//Pure viabus kernel (if you just want to experience a decoupling idea, you can only rely on this item).
//implementation "com.kunminx.viabus:viabus-core:0.4.4"
```
For details, see [Wiki - how to use ViaBus](https://github.com/KunMinX/android-viabus-architecture/wiki/How-to-use-ViaBus) .
